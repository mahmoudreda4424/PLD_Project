# PLD_Project

A course project for the **Programming Language Design (PLD)** subject. The project focuses on building a simple compiler or interpreter using syntax definition tools and C#.

## 📌 Project Description

This project demonstrates the fundamental concepts of language design and compiler construction. It includes:

- Designing a simple grammar for a custom language.
- Generating lexical analyzers and parsers.
- Building a graphical user interface (GUI) to interact with the language tools.
- Writing and compiling sample code in the custom language.

## 🗂️ Project Structure

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Assignment.txt` | The original assignment description and requirements. |
| `Form1.cs` | Windows Forms GUI code. |
| `Program.cs` | Main entry point of the application. |
| `project.cgt` | Coco/R grammar file (Token and grammar definition). |
| `project.grm` | Grammar rules for parsing. |
| `project.cs` | Auto-generated parser code or custom parsing logic. |
| `README.md` | This file, providing project overview and instructions. |

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **C#** with **.NET Framework**
- **Windows Forms** for GUI
- **Coco/R** (or similar) for lexical and syntax analysis
- Basic **Compiler Theory** concepts (lexical analysis, parsing, syntax trees)

## ✅ Features

- Custom language grammar definition
- Tokenization and parsing support
- Syntax error detection
- GUI-based user input and result display

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open the project in **Visual Studio**.
2. Restore any necessary NuGet packages (if used).
3. Build the project.
4. Run the application to test the compiler interface.

## 📷 Screenshots

*(Include a screenshot of the GUI or sample run here if possible)*

## 📚 Learnings

Through this project, I learned:

- The structure and components of a compiler.
- How to define tokens and grammar rules.
- Integrating parsing logic into a GUI application.
- Managing a small compiler pipeline from scratch.
